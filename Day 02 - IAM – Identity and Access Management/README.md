## Intro: What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)
When we talk about the power of AWS, we’re really talking about its global infrastructure — the invisible backbone that makes everything possible. It’s what allows AWS to deliver cloud services across the world with speed, reliability, and security. Behind every service you use on AWS is a network of data centers, connected through regions and availability zones, all working together to keep applications running smoothly — no matter where you or your users are.
It is designed to provide high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency for applications.#
